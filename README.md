brumhack-cristiano
==================

Having a bit of a laugh at BrumHack, was asked to see if we could get Cristiano image into anything we are building.

This is a tiny hack uses Phaser to build a breakout game was intended purely to help show how easy it is to scaffold
a HTML5 game using this library, to help them get running.

```
git clone https://github.com/kiyanwang/brumhack-cristiano.git
cd brumhack-cristiano
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open browser got to : http://localhost:8000 enjoy :)
